- Met with group to decide what API to use for the project. Decided on Open-Meteo since I have familiarity and it is good for beginners.
- Decided who is reponsible for each part of the project.

- Wrote the base code for the R wrapper. One function gets the hourly data as a dataframe. Another function to get the daily data as a dataframe. Functions to get weather feature units. A simple plotting function. Still needs error handling and unit tests, added comments. It is in a Jupyter Notebook for now, it will have to be moved to an R file.

- Presented project proposal to class and got feedback from prof.
- Discussed with team, decided to change our API wrapper to fetch weather forecasts instead of historical weather data. This way, we can make the project more unique by combining functions that find the nearest mountain summits, so we can compare the forecasted weather at different nearby summits. This project is much more unique. [](https://github.com/spandandey12/Data534_project/compare/3c1b435e209bfb45301e56bac338a2d02c2e2282...426bc95a3fe283cf73f024d36363fa84d42242ef)
